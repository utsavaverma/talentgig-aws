## Overview
Each one of us has an artist hidden in us somewhere but we do not pursue it due to multiple reasons. Some reasons we are losing out on our hobbies and talents are “Lack of Money”, “No feedbacks”, “No Opportunities”, “Daily Schedules” and many more. Moreover, there are multiple opportunities to shine but people don’t get to know about them. There are numerous opportunities and multiple artists but there is a need to connect them.
